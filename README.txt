Console Example
===============

This is a simple example that shows how to get started with Camel.

You will need to compile this example first:
  mvn compile

To run the example type
  mvn camel:run

This is seconnd task solution. It also uses text files input (see in directory) instead of MQ - for more convinient testing (otherwise you need to have AcitveMQ installed and configured with appropriate Queues). The output you can see in the directory out.
